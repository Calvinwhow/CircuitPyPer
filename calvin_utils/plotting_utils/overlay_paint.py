"""Compositing a stack of volumes onto one piece of geometry.

A finding is rarely one map.  "The motor network in red and the cognitive one in
blue, over anatomy" is three volumes on the same surface, and the honest way to
draw that is a stack: each volume is coloured independently and painted where it
survives its own threshold, later entries over earlier ones.

Every overlay is resolved here, on its own values alone, and composited over the
base coat in order.  ONE overlay takes exactly the same path as five.  It used to
short-circuit to a scalar array plus a colormap -- cheaper, and it bought a
colour bar for free -- but that made a stack's behaviour depend on its length:
deleting the second overlay restyled the first, because it landed on different
machinery with a different scale and a different meaning for opacity.  Overlays
have to be independent of each other to be trustworthy, so the bar is built
separately from ``scale_for`` instead of being bought with that divergence.

Transparency is what makes it readable.  Every overlay contributes alpha only
where it clears threshold, so the layers below show through everywhere else
instead of being hidden under a full-coverage wash of the top map's colormap.
