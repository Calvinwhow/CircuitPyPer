"""Turn a NIfTI into colour on a brain mesh.

There are two honest ways to put a volume onto a surface and they answer
different questions, so both are here and neither is the "real" one:

``paint_vertices`` samples the volume at every mesh vertex and gives a
continuous gradient.  It answers "what does the map look like where it touches
this surface" and it is the right choice for a cortical surface, because the
value it shows at a point genuinely came from that point.

``paint_parcels`` reduces the volume inside each regional mesh to one number
and floods the whole region with it.  It answers "how much does this map
implicate this structure", which is the question a parcellated figure is
usually asking.  The reduction is chosen, not assumed -- see ``parcel_stats``.

Both leave values that do not survive thresholding as NaN, which the renderer
draws in the opaque base colour.  An unpainted region therefore still reads as
anatomy rather than vanishing or turning into the bottom of the colour bar --
the distinction between "no signal here" and "the most negative value in the
figure" matters, and a colormap alone cannot make it.

Sampling geometry
-----------------
Meshes are in MNI world millimetres and volumes are in voxel indices, so every
sample goes through ``inv(affine)``.  Interior points for a parcel are found by
voxelising the mesh itself on a 1 mm world grid rather than by sampling the
volume's own voxels: the mesh is the thing that was drawn, so the mesh is the
thing whose inside should be measured, and a 1 mm grid weights every cubic
millimetre of a region equally whatever the volume's resolution happens to be.
