"""Glass-brain backdrop meshes for yabplot's voxelwise renderer.

`yabplot.plot_voxelwise` draws a statistical map as nested isosurfaces inside a
translucent context mesh, and its ``bmesh`` argument accepts a
``pyvista.PolyData`` or a ``{name: mesh}`` dict.  This module supplies the two
meshes that go there.

Both are prebuilt and ship with the package in ``resources/neuro_plotter_resources/``.
Plotting just reads them -- no marching cubes, no atlas lookup, no NIfTI, at
plot time::

    from calvin_utils.plotting_utils.glass_mesh import glass_bmesh

    yabplot.plot_voxelwise(map_path, bmesh=glass_bmesh(), ignore_bmesh=False,
                           bmesh_alpha=0.16, bmesh_color="#8d99ae")

The shipped meshes
------------------
``glass_cerebrum.vtk`` (85,700 triangles, 6 connected components)
    A smooth cerebral hull marching-cubed from the 1 mm ICBM152 mask, with the
    cerebellum and the deep grey structures **subtracted from the volume**
    before meshing.  Subtracting rather than drawing those structures on top is
    what gives them their hollow, shaded look: marching cubes emits the cavity
    walls as part of the same surface, so the whole backdrop stays one mesh
    carrying one colour and one alpha -- which is all ``plot_voxelwise``'s
    internal ``add_brain()`` can apply.  Carved: hippocampus, caudate, putamen,
    pallidum, accumbens, thalamus (aseg).  Caudate/putamen/pallidum are
    contiguous at 1 mm and fuse into one striatopallidal void per side.

``glass_cerebellum.vtk`` (69,078 triangles)
    The SUIT cerebellar surface, left and right merged into a single mesh so
    the pair shares one actor and one alpha.  Its anterior face is deeply
    invaginated around the peduncles; that inward fold is real geometry and is
    what reads as a hollow when the mesh is drawn translucent.

Neither file stores normals -- ``add_mesh(smooth_shading=True)`` recomputes
them -- which roughly halves the files on disk.

Regenerating
------------
`rebuild_glass_meshes` rebuilds the hull from source volumes.  It is the cold
path and is never called while plotting; it additionally needs nibabel, scipy
and scikit-image, plus the source mask, a cerebellar label volume and the aseg
meshes.  Use it to change what gets carved, not to plot.
