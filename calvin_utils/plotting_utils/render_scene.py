"""Camera, lighting and colour for the PyVista brain renderer.

Everything that decides *how a figure looks* -- where the camera sits, how the
brain is lit, how a range of numbers becomes colours -- lives here, so
``mesh_paint`` and ``fiber_render`` only have to decide *what* to draw.

Three things are worth knowing before changing anything:

Cameras are explicit.  ``pl.view_xy()`` and friends flip handedness depending
on their ``negative`` flag, and a mirrored brain is very hard to notice in a
figure.  Every view here is a literal (position, focal point, up) triple.

Lighting is a three-point rig with a movable key, not VTK's light kit.  The kit
fills a surface from five directions against high ambient, so nothing is ever in
shadow and nothing has form -- legible, and cartoonish.  Here one key light does
the modelling, and the fill and rim exist only to keep the dark side readable.
``rig="kit"`` is still available for reproducing a figure that was lit that way.
Every light follows the camera, so the same region is lit the same way in a
lateral view and an inferior one.

Faceted shading is a deliberate option, not an oversight.  ``faceted=True``
turns off normal interpolation, so every triangle shades as a flat plate, and
together with the light wireframe over the top it is what makes a parcellated
brain read as a tessellated model rather than as smooth jelly.  On a continuous
per-vertex gradient the same setting reads as banding, so that one case -- and
only that one -- defaults to smooth, without edges.
